**Plan for Final Deadline**   
Finish Dungeon layout (currently only on my local save, on my tiled application)

Finish Magic Menu to implement all magic tiers (1, 2, and 3)

Add enough attacks to fill each magical type (fire, water, air, earth)

Add Pause and Main Menu

Add more information on Player's HUD.  Currently the data is all displayed in Unity so the executable won't show any of that information on the player's screen. This will be changed in the final version.

Bug Testing

**What was actually accomplished**

Added Golem into arena type room

Finished magic menu so now all I need to do with it is add more magic types / attacks

Added enough attacks to fill up all of magic type air

Added Pause and Main Menu

Added player information to HUD.

Added Player Damage temporary invulnerability to avoid "double tapping" on taking damage

Added upgrades to magic menu that allow customization to the player's attack stats (speed, cooldown, damage, magic type upgrade)

Added Quest for blacksmith that grants enough exp and gold to test out the rest of the features in Magic Menu
