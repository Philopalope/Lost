# Starting Up
**Does this project run on Windows, Mac, or Linux?**  
The Build version of this Project (in Unity) states it is for Windows, Mac, and Linux so it should work.  Please give feedback if it doesn't work on Mac or Linux as I have not been able to find out if it does or not.

# Installation

**Download Files**  
You can either create a new branch or just download the ZIP file.  
  
**Run the Game**
All you have to do is run the executable :) It is located in Lost/Lost.exe 
It will ask you what screen size, graphics, and monitor you would like to use.  If the default settings look good, just hit Build and give it a go!


# Game Instructions
WASD to move around, and space bar to fire. The default is set to not fire at all so just hit M and purchase the top left most item from the magic menu. This will "unlock" the first magic attack.  I've also set it to just auto equip the magic if you hit 1, 2, or 3.  This is a temporary work around that I'm using to test out the Magic Menu. To search chests you get close and hit E. To interact with your inventory and the magic menu you use your mouse. To use an item in the inventory you can right click on the item and it will use it (if it is a useable item).  The README will be changed on the final checkpoint for a full breakdown of controls / game mechanics.
