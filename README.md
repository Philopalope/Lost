# Starting Up
**Does this project run on PC, Mac, or Linux?**  
As far as I know, it should run on all three of them.  The project template I set up from is for all three of them, however, Unity could be funky depending on the specifications of your computer.  On Linux, you might need to run Unity through Wine as well. I don't have Linux or a Mac so I will need additional time to find a friend who does (so I can figure out the steps to run it on there if it doesn't work).

# Installation

**Download Unity**  
You can download the free version of Unity by downloading from "Personal."  Follow the installation steps and run it.
  
**Download or Pull project from Github**  
Put the contents into a local file

**Open Project**  
In the Unity startup menu, select "Open" and navigate to the file that contains the project files.  In Unity, you do not open a project file. Instead, you select the folder that contains all of the assets, and load that.

**Open Scene**  
Once the project is open, you must load the only scene I have made right now.  
*File -> Open Scene -> Lost.unity* 
  
This will load the scene and allow you to compile the project.

**Run Project**  
Once you've got the scene loaded in, you can press the play button at the top and start up the game!


# Game Instructions
The game is a rogue-like 2D RPG. Use WASD or Up-Down-Left-Right arrows to control the player. Tap space bar to fire your magic attack and E to interact with NPC's and chests.  
  
You can mess around with certain in game values like Gold, Health, and even the player's attack type.  But be careful about what you change as unlinking certain GameObjects can result in the project not compiling.

If you wish to see what I've actually written or added go to *Assets -> Scripts*
