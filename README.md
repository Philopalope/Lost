# Starting Up
**Does this project run on Windows, Mac, or Linux?**  
The Build version of this Project (in Unity) states it is for Windows, Mac, and Linux so it should work.  Please give feedback if it doesn't work on Mac or Linux as I have not been able to find out if it does or not.

# Installation

**Download Files**  
You can either create a new branch or just download the ZIP file.  
  
**Run the Game**
All you have to do is run the executable :) It is located in Lost/Lost.exe 
It will ask you what screen size, graphics, and monitor you would like to use.  If the default settings look good, just hit Build and give it a go!
