**Plans for Checkpoint 2**  
Magic System Menu (Simplified to allow for easier and more effective interface)
Finish rest of the Maps / Areas (Reducing the areas a bit so I can focus on coding for the next month) 
Finish NPCâ€™s and basic Enemies (Only basic NPC's and enemies, no filler characters so I can save time)
Have first few bosses created (design the rest)  (Focus on having 1 boss fully created with actual battle sequence that has strategy)
Finish Player Combat system  (Add at least the 4 different combat types, I currently have 2)

**What was actually accomplished**  
New Boss: Golem
- includes actual stages based on bosses health, and has rewards when you kill him

Started Magic Menu: Works on first tier of magic and allows upgrades for projectile speed, rate of fire, damage, and range
Changed attack damage system and allows for rescaling so damage ups and multipliers work. 
Added magic points that allows you to spend them and upgrade in the magic menu
Created executable to allow gameplay without Unity installed

**Planned for next Deadline**  
Bug Testing

**New Plan for next Deadline**   
Finish Dungeon layout (currently only on my local save, on my tiled application)
Finish Magic Menu to implement all magic tiers (1, 2, and 3)
Add enough attacks to fill each magical type (fire, water, air, earth)
Bug Testing
