1) What you planned on doing for this homework deadline. (Copy + pasted
from your previous document)

honesty over excuses.

**Plans for HW4**  
Loot System  
Dialogue Boxes   
Shop System  
Enemy Spawning  
Sketch First Dungeon  
Fix NPC Facing system of Dialogues  
Fix Input system for Dialogues  
  
**What was actually accomplished**  
Loot system and customizable chests  
Dialogue boxes and specialized dialogue options where NPC's can give and receive quests  
Shop system that is customizable per NPC    
Fixed Input system for Shop  
Inventory (resizable)  
Magic Menu (skeleton)  

**Planned for next Deadline**  
Fix ALL Layering issues  
Magic System Menu  
Finish rest of the Maps / Areas  
Finish NPC’s and basic Enemies  
Have first few bosses created (design the rest)  
Finish Player Combat system  

Note - Inventory and Shop took me a little bit longer than expected, but are much more customizable and interactive than I had originally planned.
The reason I didn't complete some of the things on the list is because 1) They didn't fit into what I was doing which was player GUI interfaces
ie. inventory, shop, dialogue, and magic menu. Or 2) They aren't as big of a deal as finishing other portions such as fixing minor bugs (the Dialogue facing bug)

**New Plan for next Deadline**  
Enemy Spawning and Enemy AI  
Sketch First and Second Dungeon  
Draw maps for all areas, and prepare further Dungeon development and Boss design  
Build further on player inventory for more interactivity  
Add more items to game and attack moves  
Add more enemies  
Create first boss  


**Final Note**
I am nearly done with the basics of the game.  I have the bare minimum for everything the player needs to play the game.  The rest after this is just adding more enemies, attack moves, maps, quests, etc.
