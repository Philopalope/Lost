1) What you planned on doing for this homework deadline. (Copy + pasted
from your previous document)
2) What you actually accomplished for this deadline.
a) Note any differences and explain why they occurred. Prefer
honesty over excuses.
3) What you had planned to do for the next deadline.
a) Any changes you would like to make to this plan for the next
deadline and the reasoning behind each change.
4) Screenshots of where your app/program/etc is currently at. They don’t
have to be exhaustive but they should adequately depict the current state
of your project.

**Plans for HW5**  
Fix ALL Layering issues  
Magic System Menu  
Finish rest of the Maps / Areas  
Finish NPC’s and basic Enemies  
Have first few bosses created (design the rest)  
Finish Player Combat system  
-> I didn't realize it would be over spring break and such a short time period, so of course I didn't have any time at all to work on this
  
**What was actually accomplished**  
Inventory improvements: 
- Fixed swapping issue where data would be lost when switching to empty slot 
- Added Discard option and additional data to items stored to allow stacked data to be dropped and picked up

**Planned for next Deadline**  
Fix ALL Layering issues  
Magic System Menu  
Finish rest of the Maps / Areas  
Finish NPC’s and basic Enemies  
Have first few bosses created (design the rest)  
Finish Player Combat system  

**New Plan for next Deadline**   
Magic System Menu (Simplified to allow for easier and more effective interface)
Finish rest of the Maps / Areas (Reducing the areas a bit so I can focus on coding for the next month) 
Finish NPC’s and basic Enemies (Only basic NPC's and enemies, no filler characters so I can save time)
Have first few bosses created (design the rest)  (Focus on having 1 boss fully created with actual battle sequence that has strategy)
Finish Player Combat system  (Add at least the 4 different combat types, I currently have 2)


**Final Note**
Other classes are ramping up, and the point exercises are not helping one bit, so I will need to scale down the game (content, not implementations) so that I can finish on time. what I mean by this is that I will need to focus on fully implementing something and showing that it works, rather than having EVERYTHING finished, such as dungeons.  I would rather have 1 dungeon fully created and designed with a functional boss rather than 4 incomplete dungeons that aren't done.  Same goes for the combat system.  If I decided to go back and add more instances of a certain system that is finished, I can do so in my free time.  

**Okay really, Final FINAL Note**
I'm working on getting the executable file for this project so that it can run on the desktop for users without a complicated process of having to download Unity.  I'll try and have the executable in my repo by the end of the weekend!
